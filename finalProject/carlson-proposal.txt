Interactive Audio FALL 2015
Final Project Proposal

Before I begin this proposal I would like to note that this proposal is
contingent upon the ability to actually have the objects that I have
in mind for this composition.  If these objects are not available to
me I will need to figure out a different project.

1. Concisely describe your final project
My final project will be a composition/performance for Acoustic Guitar
and multi-channel effects such as reverb, chorus, delay, flange,
octavation, etc.  I would like to be able to dynamically control these
effects in real-time.  

2. Provide details about the audio generation / manipulation.
An adc~ object will receive the audio signal coming from the acoustic
guitar.  This signal will be routed to various effects that will be
created in pd.  These various effects will manipulate the signal
through ctrlin objects which will be connected to control interfaces
in the real-world which will hopefully be manipulate through the feet
or other non-arm appendages.

3. Provide details about the user interaction.
I believe that the use of MIDI or OSC will allow me to control these
effects.  I imagine that an expression pedal or some other such this
is available that would interface with the user in such a way that it
could control such variables as reverb space, chorus depth, or delay
time.

4. List any external hardware (excluding a stereo speaker setup)
required.
  - 4-8 speakers
  - An interface which can handle 4-8 output channels
  - Some sort of machine which will allow the user to interface with
    the control variables of PD.
  - An acoustic guitar with the ability to output a clean quality
    signal (I can supply this)
